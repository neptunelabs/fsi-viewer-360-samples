# Using FSI Viewer for 360째 Image Zoom - Points Of Interest

This readme describes how a simple example of a 360째 detail page including points of interest is achieved with *FSI Viewer*.
The aim of the demo is to show how you can easily integrate spin images with zoom by just adding a simple viewer tag.
The points of interest are achieved using the FSI ThumbBar.


In order to display 360째 zoom with FSI Viewer, you just need to add the follwoing script to the head of your website:

```html
<script
  src='https://docs.neptunelabs.com/fsi/viewer/applications/viewer/js/fsiviewer.js'
</script>
```
This will ensure that the FSI Viewer is loaded.

Next, you need to place the *<fsi-viewer>* tag you see in the Publish section where you want the viewer to appear.
In our example this looks like this:

```html
   <fsi-viewer
  id="FSI_EDBeF84CxSVR"
  width="80%"
  height="100%"
  ir="/images/samples/cruiser/"
  backgroundColor="#f8f9fa"
  cfg="showcase_presets/showcase-cruiser.xml"
  plugins="Resize,FullScreen">
</fsi-viewer>
```

The difference between the normal 2D viewer and the 360째 viewer is that the latter uses *dir* instead of *src*.

Now we want to have some points of interest. This is achieved by setting them in an XML configuration.
This is discussed in a tutorial on our website: [Points Of Interest Tutorial](https://www.neptunelabs.com/fsi-viewer-js/multiple-spins-showcase/).

The resulting viewer with thumbbar looks like this:

```html
<div id="Container_FSI_EDBeF84CxSVR" style="position:relative;width:100%;height:700px;box-sizing:border-box;padding-right:200px;">
          <fsi-viewer id="FSI_EDBeF84CxSVR" width="80%" height="100%" debug="true" dir="/images/samples/cruiser/" backgroundColor="#f8f9fa" cfg="showcase_presets/showcase-cruiser.xml" plugins="Resize,FullScreen" fullScreenElement="Container_FSI_EDBeF84CxSVR">
          </fsi-viewer>
          <fsi-thumbbar viewerSelector="FSI_EDBeF84CxSVR" width="20%" height="100%" debug="true" style="position:absolute;bottom:0px;height:100%;width:200px;left:728px; text-align: center" cfg="showcase_presets/showcase-cruiser.xml" autoElementSpacing="true" elementWidth="20%" vertical="true"></fsi-thumbbar>
        </div>
```

For all parameters which can be used, please consult the [manual](https://docs.neptunelabs.com/fsi-viewer/latest/fsi-viewer).

## Testing with examples from your own server

To test the examples with images from your own [FSI Server](https://www.neptunelabs.com/fsi-server/), please first copy the env.yml.dist file to env.yml and adapt the file, then restart the main demo again.
