# Using FSI Viewer for 360째 Image Zoom with Hotspots

This readme describes how a a 360째 sample with Hotspots using *FSI Viewer* is achieved.
The aim of the demo is to show how you can easily integrate spin images with zoom and hotspots.

In order to display 360째 zoom with FSI Viewer, you just need to add the following script

```html
<script
  src='https://fsi.domain.tld/fsi/viewer/applications/viewer/js/fsiviewer.js'
</script>
```
This will ensure that the FSI Viewer is loaded.

Next, you need to place the *<fsi-viewer>* tag you see in the Publish section where you want the viewer to appear.
In our example this looks like this:

```html
<fsi-viewer adaptiveuisize="false"
            forceinplacezoom="true"
            dir="images/samples/notebook_sphere/"
            cfg="samples/notebook.xml"
            autodisablepointeractions="true"
            progressbarheight="20"
            progressbarwidth="30"
            progressbarvalign="center"
            inplacezoom="true"
            nonav="false"
            skin="white"
            plugins="FullScreen,Resize"
            width="100%"
            height="600px"
            debug="false"
>
</fsi-viewer>
```
The difference between the normal 2D viewer and the 360 viewer is that the latter uses *dir* instead of *src*.
We set the skin to **skin="white"**, added **nonav="false"** and tweaked a few other things to our liking.

For all the parameters that can be used, please refer to the [manual](https://docs.neptunelabs.com/fsi-viewer/latest/fsi-viewer).

# Adding hotspots

The hotspots are loaded by setting **cfg="samples/notebook.xml"**.

We have a detailed tutorial on how to create hotspots for 360째 images here: [Creating HotSpots for FSI Viewer](https://www.neptunelabs.com/fsi-viewer-js/creating-hotspots-for-fsi-viewer-js/)

## Testing with examples from your own server

To test the examples with images from your own [FSI Server](https://www.neptunelabs.com/fsi-server/), first copy the env.yml.dist file to env.yml and edit the file, then restart the main demo.
